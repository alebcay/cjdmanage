cjdmanage
=========

The command line manager for handling a cjdns installation

The latest version is **1.03.06**.

Overview
--------
cjdmanage is a command line manager for managing [`cjdns`](http://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) (**C**aleb **J**ames **D**eLisle's **N**etwork **S**uite). If you know how to use `apt` on a *nix system, then you already have the basics of cjdmanage set out for you.

Features (that are actually worth mentioning)
---------------------------------------------
* Install, remove, update, and manage the cjdroute service all from one program
* Don't have `git` installed? Don't worry! cjdmanage can also download, install, and update with `wget` or `curl` instead (for that, you'll need `tar` or `unzip` installed though)
* Schedule a daily autoupdate for `cjdns` (through `cron`)

Syntax and Usage
----------------

* `cjdmanage install` Installs the latest version of `cjdns` to the subdirectory `./cjdns/`, pulled fresh from the GitHub repository
* `cjdmanage remove` Removes the installation of `cjdns` (moves your .conf file to `./cjdroute.conf` in case you need it)
* `cjdmanage update` Updates the copy of `cjdns` located in `./cjdns/` to the latest version pulled from GitHub
* `cjdmanage start` Starts cjdroute
* `cjdmanage stop` Stops all instances of cjdroute
* `cjdmanage autoupdate` Toggles whether or not cjdmanage should automatically update cjdns for you
* `cjdmanage rebase` Gets the latest version of cjdmanage from GitHub: important for bug fixes, etc.

Installation
------------

cjdmanage is written as a Bash shell script. Therefore, no compilation is necessary.

### One Line Install Method
**CAUTION: You should *always* review any code that you're asked to pipe from `curl` to `sh` - in this case however, the Bash script is right here in this repository, for your convenience.**

I'm still working on the one line install method. It should be done pretty soon.

### With Git
1. Pick a convenient location to clone cjdmanage to. cjdns will be installed into a subdirectory of this location, so choose wisely.
2. `git clone https://github.com/alebcay/cjdmanage.git`
3. `cd cjdmanage`
4. `chmod +x ./cjdmanage`
5. All set! See "Syntax and Usage" to get started.

*Note: You still need to find peers on Hyperboria or elsewhere in order to get off the ground. cjdmanage (and all the money in the world) can't buy you friends.*


### Without fussing with the doggone command line
1. Download the archive of the latest version:
   * ZIP: http://github.com/alebcay/cjdmanage/archive/master.zip
   * TAR.GZ: http://github.com/alebcay/cjdmanage/archive/master.tar.gz
2. Extract contents to a convenient location. cjdns will be installed into a subdirectory of this location, so choose wisely.
3. Enter the subdirectory `cjdmanage-master` (you can actually rename that to whatever you want).
4. Give execute permissions to the file `cjdmanage`.
5. In the end, you still need the command line. Maybe that's because it's a *command line tool*. See "Syntax and Usage" to get started.

Editing/Modifying
-----------------
cjdmanage is a Bash shell script, so just open it in a text editor and make whatever changes you want. Then save it and run it again.

If you care to contribute to cjdmanage, feel free to fork and send pull requests. I'll try my best to review them. If someone would like to make a GUI wrapper for this, I think it would turn out quite nice.
