{"name":"cjdmanage","tagline":"A command line manager for handling a cjdns installation","body":"Overview\r\n--------\r\ncjdmanage is a command line manager for managing [`cjdns`](http://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) (**C**aleb **J**ames **D**eLisle's **N**etwork **S**uite). If you know how to use `apt` on a *nix system, then you already have the basics of cjdmanage set out for you.\r\n\r\nWhat makes cjdmanage a big freaking deal\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n* Install, remove, update, and manage the cjdroute service all from one program\r\n* Don't have Git? Don't worry! cjdmanage can also download, install, and update with `wget` or `curl` instead (for that, you'll need `tar` or `unzip` installed though)\r\n***\r\nSyntax and Usage\r\n----------------\r\n* `cjdmanage install` Installs the latest version of `cjdns` to the subdirectory `./cjdns/`, pulled fresh from the GitHub repository\r\n* `cjdmanage remove` Removes the installation of `cjdns` (moves your .conf file to `./cjdroute.conf` in case you need it)\r\n* `cjdmanage update` Updates the copy of `cjdns` located in `./cjdns/` to the latest version pulled from GitHub\r\n* `cjdmanage start` Starts cjdroute\r\n* `cjdmanage stop` Stops all instances of cjdroute\r\n***\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\ncjdmanage is written as a Bash shell script. Therefore, no compilation is necessary.\r\n### One Line Install Method\r\n**CAUTION: You should *always* review any code that you're asked to pipe from `curl` to `sh` - in this case however, the Bash script is right here in this repository, for your convenience.**\r\n\r\nI'm still working on the one line install method. It should be done pretty soon.\r\n\r\n### With Git\r\n1. Pick a convenient location to clone cjdmanage to. cjdns will be installed into a subdirectory of this location, so choose wisely.\r\n2. `git clone https://github.com/alebcay/cjdmanage.git`\r\n3. `cd cjdmanage`\r\n4. `chmod +x ./cjdmanage`\r\n5. All set! See \"Syntax and Usage\" to get started.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: You still need to find peers on Hyperboria or elsewhere in order to get off the ground. cjdmanage (and all the money in the world) can't buy you friends.*\r\n***\r\n### Without fussing with the doggone command line\r\n1. Download the archive of the latest version:\r\n   * ZIP: http://github.com/alebcay/cjdmanage/archive/master.zip\r\n   * TAR.GZ: http://github.com/alebcay/cjdmanage/archive/master.tar.gz\r\n2. Extract contents to a convenient location. cjdns will be installed into a subdirectory of this location, so choose wisely.\r\n3. Enter the subdirectory `cjdmanage-master` (you can actually rename that to whatever you want).\r\n4. Give execute permissions to the file `cjdmanage`.\r\n5. In the end, you still need the command line. Maybe that's because it's a *command line tool*. See \"Syntax and Usage\" to get started.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: You still need to find peers on Hyperboria or elsewhere in order to get off the ground. cjdmanage (and all the money in the world) can't buy you friends.*\r\n***\r\nEditing/Modifying\r\n-----------------\r\ncjdmanage is a Bash shell script, so just open it in a text editor and make whatever changes you want. Then save it and run it again.\r\n***\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nIf you care to contribute to cjdmanage, feel free to fork and send pull requests. I'll try my best to review them. If someone would like to make a GUI wrapper for this, I think it would turn out quite nice.\r\n***\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\ncjdmanage is released under the Affero GPL (AGPL).
